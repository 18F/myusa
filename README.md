MyUSA ([my.usa.gov](https://my.usa.gov)) is a reusable platform for agencies to rapidly build government services.  MyUSA consists of:

- An easier way for Americans to sign in to and register with federal websites.
- A way for Americans to manage their interactions with the Federal government.
- A way for Americans to store the work they have ongoing with various government websites for later use.

MyUSA capabilities can be embedded in websites or accessed through APIs by client organizations. With the MyUSA website, Americans can directly manage their preferences, profile information, and government services.

Use of MyUSA is governed by the [MyUSA Terms and Conditions](https://github.com/18F/myusa/wiki/Terms-of-Service).

Technically, MyUSA consists of:

- An OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect provider
- APIs for reading user profiles
- APIs for sending notifications or creating tasks for users
- A web application for managing your interaction with MyUSA, such as updating your profile
- A website with information about MyUSA

MyUSA is a service of [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov) and the [Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/25729) at the [General Services Administration](http://gsa.gov).
