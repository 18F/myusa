# Group Overview

MyUSA is an openly accessible service designed to make life easier for app developers and users. It provides:
* **an Authentication and Authorization gateway**, which means apps don't need their own sign-in/sign-up screens
* **a Profile system**, which helps users save time as they fill out forms
* **a Notification service**, making it fast and free for apps to send email and SMS notifications to specific users
