# Group Overview

MyUSA is an openly-accessible service designed to make life easier for both app developers and users. It provides:
* **an Authentication and Authorization gateway**, so that apps don't need their own sign-in/sign-up screens
* **a Profile system**, helping users save time in filling out forms
* **a Notification service**, making it fast and free for apps to send email and SMS notifications to specific users
