# Group Branding Guidelines

These guidelines provide the design specifications for how to use the MyUSA brand
with your application.  You can use these assets on your website or in your
application so long as they comply with the MyUSA Terms of Service.

The use of the MyUSA brand in any way not disclosed in this document or the
Terms of Services requires explicit approval.  Note that the MyUSA brand or
any affiliated government organization may not be used to imply an
endorsement of an organization (including a nonprofit), product, person,
or service.
