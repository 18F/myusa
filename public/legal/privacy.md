# Group Privacy policy

We hold your privacy in the highest regard. MyUSA collects some anonymous information automatically to help us improve the service (such as what parts of our system are being used when). MyUSA also gives you an option to provide basic personal information, which we’ll use to customize your experience and simplify many common tasks. MyUSA has a few fundamental principles:

1. Your personal information is primarily used to improve or customize your experience.
1. The information you provide is your information and you can delete your account and associated information at any time.
1. We’ll ask you before we share your information with an agency or other government entity, except where required by law or as detailed in our [System of Records Notice](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-07-05/pdf/2013-16124.pdf)).
1. We never store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.

## Generally
We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We collect no personal information unless you choose to provide that information to us.  An assessment of the privacy impact of MyUSA is in our [Privacy Impact Assessment](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/getMediaData?mediaId=180583).

## Information collected automatically
Like most website operators, as you use our service, either directly or indirectly, we may collect and store the following non-personally-identifiable (a.k.a. anonymous) information about your visit:

- the date and time you access MyUSA;
- the various components of MyUSA you access;
- if you access the MyUSA from another website or application - the identity of that third-party;
- the technical capabilities of the computer you use to access our site, and
- the IP address (an anonymous number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the internet) from which you access MyUSA.

We use this information, in the aggregate, to make MyUSA more useful to users — to learn about the number of and type of users of MyUSA, the components utilized, the types of technology used, to detect operational problems, and to improve MyUSA’s overall security.

## Information that you provide voluntarily
Certain users of our service choose to interact with it in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that we gather depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, if you add your name and street address to your MyUSA profile, we may offer to pre-fill common fields as you complete a form. In each case, we collect such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the user’s interaction with us. We do not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described in our [System of Records Notice](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-07-05/pdf/2013-16124.pdf). Users may refuse to supply personally-identifying information at any time, with the understanding that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Login information
When using our Service, you may be prompted with the opportunity to create a MyUSA account, or use an existing, third-party service to identify yourself (such as Google or PayPal). If you chose to do so, MyUSA will have access to the e-mail address you provide directly to MyUSA, or, possibly, indirectly via the third-party service. Unless you explicitly state otherwise, this pseudo-anonymous information will remain private to your account, and will only be used for notification and to simplify the process of retrieving your account on subsequent uses of the MyUSA Service.

## Profile information
The Service offers the opportunity to store personally identifiable information (such as your name or address). We want you to feel comfortable trusting MyUSA with this basic profile information. Storing such information allows MyUSA to better customize many common tasks, such as pre-filling common fields across multiple forms. This information will remain private to your account.  Your information will only be shared if you explicitly grant permission, where required by law, or as described in our [System of Records Notice](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-07-05/pdf/2013-16124.pdf). You may delete your personal information at any time.

## Prohibition on use of personal information
You take your privacy seriously, and so do we. At no time will your profile or login information (the information you provide voluntarily) be used without your explicit permission (except where required by law or described in the [System of Records Notice](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-07-05/pdf/2013-16124.pdf)) or combined with the automatically collected, anonymous information, or otherwise used to identify or track your individual use of the Service.

## How information is used
The information we collect is used to improve our service such as providing you with a more customized or simpler experience. We make every effort to disclose clearly how information is used at the point where it is collected so that you can determine for yourself whether you wish to provide the information.

## Sharing and disclosure
The information you give us is kept private and is not shared with anyone, unless you provide explicit permission, disclosure is required by law, or as described in our [System of Records Notice](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-07-05/pdf/2013-16124.pdf).

## Retention of information
We destroy the information we collect when the purpose for which it was provided has been fulfilled, unless we are required to keep it longer by statute or official policy. Electronically submitted information is maintained and destroyed according to the principles of the Federal Records Act and the regulations and records schedules approved by the National Archives and Records Administration. In some cases information submitted to us may become an agency record and therefore might be subject to a Freedom of Information Act request, except where the information is covered by an exemption.

## Security
For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, we employ software to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.

Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration guidelines.

If such monitoring reveals evidence of possible abuse or criminal activity, such evidence may be provided to appropriate law enforcement officials. Unauthorized attempts to upload or change information on this server are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act or other law.

## Cookies
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. In order to provide a more streamlined experience and to track aggregate usage information, by default, we store small amounts of data on your computer. We uses cookies to help identify and track visitors, their usage of our services, and their website access preferences. We also use cookies to maintain your login session. If you wish to opt-out of this feature, you may do so by following [these instructions](http://www.usa.gov/optout-instructions.shtml), although due to technical limitations, you may lose the ability to access certain information or services.
