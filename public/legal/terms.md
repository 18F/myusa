# Group Terms of service

The [General Services Administration](http://www.gsa.gov) ("GSA") develops and maintains MyUSA, a shared service that simplifies interacting with the Federal government online. MyUSA is provided "as-is" and entirely free. 

## Scope

MyUSA (hereafter, the “Service”) provides users with a persistent online persona to interact with government services. MyUSA is offered subject to your acceptance of the terms and conditions contained herein as well as any relevant sections of the [MyUSA Privacy Policy](#privacy-policy) (collectively, the “Agreement”). The Service is made available to individuals who are at least 18 years of age. Use of MyUSA, either by public individuals, entities, or Federal agencies, constitutes acceptance to this Agreement.

Please be sure to read this Agreement carefully before using this website or its related services. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, then you may not access the website or use the services it provides.

All of the services, content, documentation, code and related materials made available to you through the Service are subject to these terms. Access to or use of the Service or its content, whether directly or programmatically (e.g., via an application programming interface (API) or third-party application), constitutes acceptance to this Agreement.

## Use
You may use any MyUSA service directly or via third-party applications to store profile and related information, and to search, display, analyze, retrieve, view or otherwise “get” any information made available by the Service.

If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a company, Federal agency, or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity, its affiliates and all users who access our services through your account to the Agreement, in which case the terms "you" or "your" shall refer to such entity, its affiliates and users associated with it. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the Agreement, you must not accept this Agreement and may not use the services.

## Attribution

While not required, when using content, data, documentation, code, and related materials from MyUSA in your own work, we ask that proper credit be given. An example citation is provided below:

_Powered by [MyUSA](https://my.usa.gov)_

You may use the MyUSA name or logos in order to identify the source of the content or service subject to these rules. You may not use the MyUSA name, logo, or the like to imply endorsement of any product, service, or entity, not-for-profit, commercial or otherwise. GSA will not be liable for any false statements or misrepresentations made by you or on your behalf as a result of your use of the Service.

## Your account
If you create a MyUSA account (or log in to the Service using a third-party login) or integrate MyUSA into an application, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account or application and are fully responsible for the activities that occur any actions taken therein. You must immediately notify MyUSA of any unauthorized use of your account or breaches of security. GSA will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.

## The information you submit
The information you submit will remain private to you, unless you explicitly authorize an application or agency to use it at the time. It is your responsibility to ensure the information submitted to agencies and other government entities, by you or on your behalf, is and remains factual, complete, and accurate.

## Modification or false representation of content
You may not modify or falsely represent content accessed through the Service and still claim the source is MyUSA.

## Right to limit
Your use of the Service may be subject to certain limitations on access, calls, or use as set forth within this Agreement or otherwise provided by MyUSA. If GSA reasonably believes that you have attempted to exceed or circumvent these limits, your ability to use the Service may be permanently or temporarily blocked. GSA may monitor your use of the Service to improve the application or to insure compliance with this Agreement.

## Service termination
If you wish to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by refraining from further use of MyUSA. GSA reserves the right (though not the obligation) to refuse to provide MyUSA to you if it is GSA's opinion that use violates any GSA or Federal policy or law. GSA also reserves the right to stop providing MyUSA at any time for any reason in its sole discretion. All provisions of this Agreement, which by their nature should survive termination, shall survive termination including warranty disclaimers and limitations of liability.

## Changes
GSA reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace this Agreement, in whole or in part. Your continued use of or access to MyUSA following posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes acceptance of those modified terms. MyUSA may, in the future, offer new capabilities and/or features through the MyUSA. Such new features and/or capabilities shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

## Disclaimer of warranties
MyUSA is provided “as is” and on an “as-available” basis. GSA will do its best to ensure MyUSA is available and functional as much as possible, GSA hereby disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including without limitation the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. GSA makes no warranty that MyUSA data will be error free or that access thereto will be continuous or uninterrupted.

## Limitations on liability
In no event will GSA be liable with respect to any subject matter of this Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (1) any special, incidental, or consequential damages; (2) the cost of procurement of substitute products or services; or (3) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data.

## Miscellaneous
This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between GSA and you concerning the subject matter hereof, and may only be modified by the posting of a revised version on this page by GSA.

## Disputes
Any disputes arising out of this Agreement and access to or use of the Service shall be governed by federal law.

## No waiver of rights
GSA's failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute waiver of such right or provision.
